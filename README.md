# QuantumBlockCipher
QuantumBlockCipher is a program that implements a small circuit scale block cipher   on a quantum circuit using Qiskit.

# Description
This is a program that implements CipherA, CipherB, and CipherC with different numbers of encryption keys and Sboxes. Three types of input / output qubits are available: 9qubit, 8qubit, and 7qubit.
We also have a classic implementation to compare implementation times.

#Requirement 
Python 3.9.7 Qiskit 0.30.0
